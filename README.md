## About
Here I am experimenting with deveral different API's, some that require API keys. When the call is made to these API's the API key is exposed in the network stack trace and waterfall view. To resolve this, I converted these API calls into my own REST API End Points from my server. Now when the call is made, the API key is not exposed.
